                <h2><a href="project2main/proj.html">Welcome to Glass+</a></h2>
                
                <p>Our project has undergone many changes, but we've kept a central theme throughout. At the end of our journey, we've implemented an interface that we are truly proud of. Our interface is centered around simplicity, symmetry, and ease of use. </p>
                
                <h1>Final Design</h1>
                <img src="project2main/Accounts.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Upon startup, the user is presented with a home screen feauturing large, rounded buttons that take up most of the screen. The user has the option to log in as a frequent user, continue as a guest, or enter a tutorial that will show the user how to utilize the mirror. We chose to use white text on gray buttons, because they will be slightly translucent for a user to use on a screen and we wanted the interface to be non-invasive. We also made sure that all the buttons lined up on a grid so as to provide consistency throughout the design.</p>
                <img src="project2main/Accounts2.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>The login screen displays large icons for different users, and also includes the ability for users to decide that they do not want to log in and to continue as a guest.</p>
                <img src="project2main/Alerts.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>The home screen offers a multitude of docked features that are available to the user throughout their experience. The reason for implementing this design was twofold. We decided that the consistency in the design would make new users comfortable with the interface quickly. Additionally, we decided that the interface would allow for much quicker use for experienced users once they were accustomed to the placement of all the buttons. In the upper left hand corner is the current weather and an illustration of the type of weather. In the top middle is a greeting to the user. In the top right corner is the time and date. In the bottom left hand corner is a gear icon representing the settings menu. In the bottom right is a silhouette of a user that is meant to change users. There are a variety of options to go through across the bottom of the dashboard, including Plan, News, Health, Social, and Media which will be discussed in detail later. We also implemented an Alerts menu which will bring up information that is the most important to the user, including social media notifications, traffic updates, etc. These are also clickable, and will open up the designated folder. We implemented an alert menu in order to give the user important information quickly. We consider this design to be successful because it shows all the most important information in large, white lettering that is easy to read. Additionally, the blue highlight is the least likely to pose problems for color blind individuals, so we planned ahead for color blind users. We categorized all the options that we deemed important in a way that allows the home screen to be extensive, yet clean and without clutter. We also aligned all of our icons along a grid for consistency and ease of use.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="pics/mod/a.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>This is what the home screen looks like if the user has alerts. The alerts will appear in a window that is front and center. To exit this panel you simply tap anywhere outside that small panel. You can also click on the alerts which will send you to the respective menu that the alert came from.</p>
                    <br>
                <img src="pics/mod/5.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Upon clicking the weather logo, a popup will appear showing the daily weather and hourly forecast. Based on the weather forecast, the mirror will also suggest an outfit to wear for the day.</p>
                <p>At any given moment when looking at a screen like this you can swipe from the middle of the screen to push all viewable items to the side, and then swipe back from the side to bring back whatever you were viewing.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="pics/sketch/6.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Upon clicking the time and date, a calender will appear that highlights the date. The calendar works like your average calendar app (Google Calendar, etc). It will allow you to add tasks and set event reminders and things like that.</p>
                    <br>
                <img src="pics/mod/plan.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>If the user clicks on the Plan menu, several features will show up. On the left side is an agenda listing the user's tasks for the day. On the right hand side will be three quick feautres, a shortcut to Uber, Google Maps, and a Google search bar.</p>
                    <br>
                <img src="pics/mod/oneclick.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>The user also has an option to select/add quick shop items. The icons you see above work like Amazon dash buttons. They are preconfigured to place an order at the click of a button. Once you select that button, you will have ordered that item and it will be delivered to your house at the earliest convenience. These buttons are all at the moment in disabled state, which means they are in stock. However, they will light up to let you know if you are running out or about to run out (this is based on usage time, so every three months you'll get an alert for detergent or shampoo, etc).</p>
                    <br>
                <img src="pics/sketch/8.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Upon clicking the News tab, a Google news feed will appear.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="pics/sketch/9.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Upon clicking the Health tab, information will show up depicting the user's current weight, time slept and time spent in REM the night before, steps taken yesterday, and a bar chart showing how that compares to the previous week's steps.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="pics/mod/health.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Upon clicking the Toothbrush Music mode in the health screen, a timer will appear counting down from two minutes and a random song from Spotify will be selected, aiding the user to brush for the recommended time by dentists.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="pics/mod/s.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Upon clicking the Social tab, four commonly used social media apps will appear with the option to press on any of them.</p>
                    <br>
                 <img src="pics/sketch/20.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Upon clicking facebook, a facebook feed will appear.</p>
                    <br>
                <img src="pics/sketch/21.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">

                <br>

                <br>

                    <br>

                <p>The guest option has most of the same feautres, but removes most of the logged-in options such as spotify, social media, agendas, etc.</p>
                </p>
                <br>
                 <img src="pics/mod/light.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Another feature our mirror will have is how the screen light changes based on the time of the day. As you can see, the warmer hues in this picture show a screen that is easier to look at. Such a screen may kick in when the user is using the mirror at night. At various times of the day the mirror will reflect hues accordingly to make sure eye strain is minimized. This feature, of course, can be turned off.
                </p>
                <br>
                 <img src="pics/mod/off.jpg" alt="mirror" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
                <p>Finally, when the mirror is turned off or is on standby, this is how the mirror will appear--like a normal mirror.
